The Broadcom GPU doesn’t have very much dedicated memory at all. In fact, the only RAM that’s directly accessible is 4,096 bytes in an area known as Vertex Program Memory.
There are actually 12 cores inside the GPU, each one known as a QPU for Quad Processing Unit.
several people mentioned that the Texture Memory Unit or TMU was a lot more efficient than VPM.
